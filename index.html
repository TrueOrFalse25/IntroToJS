            The Great Divide
        </h4>
        <p>
            In the world of web pregramming, there was once conflict. The burden of grouping text was
            left to the <span>monkeys</span> whose skills in such areas were so lacking that they 
            could do little more than press the <b><i>Enter</i></b> key over and over again.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then there dame the <span>DIV</span> and the <span>SPAN</span>. Lo these mighty tags
            brought peace to the realm and the <span>monkeys</span> lived happily ever after.
        </p>
        <h6>
            This text is a complete fabrication and utter nonsense. The management takes no 
            responsibility for anyone who believes that any of this has any basis in fact.

        This text is inside of a &lt;div&gt;<br />
        This character &#161; has the value #161.
